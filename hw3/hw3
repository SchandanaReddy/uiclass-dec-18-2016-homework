1)first pull the code which is having merge conflict and open the code file,remove  <<<<< HEAD,=====,>>>>>,then stage the file and commit by giving  appropriate message,now pull the code after successfully completion of that push the code.
2)HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely used language to write Web Pages.

Hypertext refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked together. Thus the link available on a webpage are called Hypertext.
 Markup Language which means we use HTML to simply "mark up" a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to display.

How to create a html document?
 A basic html page is created by using the f0llowing tags.
<!DOCTYPE...>	This tag defines the document type and HTML version.
<html>	This tag encloses the complete HTML document and mainly comprises of document header which is represented by <head>...</head> and document body which is represented by <body>...</body> tags.
<head>	This tag represents the document's header which can keep other HTML tags like <title>, <link> etc.
<title>	The <title> tag is used inside the <head> tag to mention the document title.
<body>	This tag represents the document's body which keeps other HTML tags like <h1>, <div>, <p> etc.
  we can also use many other tags like headings,paragraphs and lists.

3)<!DOCTYPE...>	This tag defines the document type and HTML version

4)tagname will provide meaning to the content.(we wont see tagname in the webpage).

  element:An HTML element is defined by a starting tag. If the element contains other content, it ends with a closing tag, where the element name is preceded by a forward slash as shown below with few tags:

Start Tag	Content          	End Tag
<p>	    This is paragraph content.	</p>
<h1>	    This is heading content.	</h1>
<div>	    This is division content.	</div>
<br />		
So here <p>....</p> is an HTML element, <h1>...</h1> is another HTML element. There are some HTML elements which don't need to be closed, such as <img.../>, <hr /> and <br /> elements. These are known as void elements.


5)within the open tag..if we wish to add more inforamation..we use attributtes.

6)<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>This is document title</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>Document content goes here.....</p>
</body>
</html>
